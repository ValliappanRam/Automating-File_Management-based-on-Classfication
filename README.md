# Automating-File_Management-based-on-Classfication

Hello All. I build a app for Automation of File Management System which involves to pick the files from our messy downloads folder and 
move to the specified location based on the rules return in rules.TXT.

Fillup and Modify your rules file. And get to move all the files to a particular location with classification.

One highlight feature about this system is , it automatically creates the folders for you if the category folder is not availble.

Feel free to reach out to me at any case: aravind.valliappan@gmail.com

Note: You can find the app "FMS.exe" in the dist folder in the repository. 

Note 2: You have to modify the rules file based on your requirements and Place it follwing location for windows users : C:\Users\"username"
